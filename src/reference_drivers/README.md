Reference Drivers
====

This directory contains sources for a few reference implementations of the
IpczDriver API. *This is not part of the ipcz library implementation.*

Drivers here are suitable for test environments and to serve as an example for
production implementations to draw from, but in general they are not designed or
intended to be used in a production environment.

The multiprocess reference driver in particular is likely to have security flaws
and is therefore *NOT SAFE* to use outside of tests.
